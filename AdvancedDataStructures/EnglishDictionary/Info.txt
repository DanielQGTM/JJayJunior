                                Prompt: 
Create a C++ program that mimics an English Dictionary utilizing principles
of Object Oriented Programming. The project requires the implementation of the 
Dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) using templates and an EnglishDictionary class,
which will utilize an object of the concrete implementation of the Dictionary ADT
as a data structure to store words and definitions and perform operations on them.
 
                                Summary: 
The project implements an English Dictionary using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
principles. I used these principles to store words and their multiple definitions while 
providing efficient operations for adding, retrieving, and deleting entries. The program 
uses a templated NodeDictionaryG class as the underlying Abstract Data Type (ADT) that uses
a doubly linked list for managing key-value pairs. The EnglishDictionary class encapsulates 
this functionality, enabling operations such as adding definitions, finding words, retrieving 
ranges of definitions, and removing entries either by key or iterator. The program is further 
simplified using different classes for nodes-DNodeG, iterators-IteratorG, and ranges-Range. A 
test of the program that key operations can be dealt with while keeping accurate counts of the 
total entries and unique words.
